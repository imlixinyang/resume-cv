## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg"> -->

Hi! I am currently an undergraduate from Xiamen University waiting for the begining of my master's degree in [MAC Lab](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn).

I'm really interested in Computer Vision, including Image Generation, Text-to-Image Tranlsation and Image-to-Image Translation.

I aim at find out the Imagination Ability of Deep Neural Network in vision area. 

You can find my publication and source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/imlixinyang).

Email me at [imlixinyang@gmail.com](imlixinyang@gmail.com) any time!
